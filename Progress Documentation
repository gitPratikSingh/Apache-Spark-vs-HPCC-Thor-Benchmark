Need to find a benchmark which lists the exact sql queries to run - and not just templates
2 benchmarks suggested by Chin - 
  HiBench
  Spark-Perf

HiBench
Found 4 queries - one of each type - aggregate, join, load, etc
https://github.com/intel-hadoop/HiBench/blob/master/sparkbench/sql/src/main/scala/com/intel/hibench/sparkbench/sql/ScalaSparkSQLBench.scala
It uses some ‘sql_file’ which contains sql commands and runs it over in Hive.

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS uservisits;
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE uservisits (sourceIP STRING,destURL STRING,visitDate STRING,adRevenue DOUBLE,userAgent STRING,countryCode STRING,languageCode STRING,searchWord STRING,duration INT ) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde' STORED AS  SEQUENCEFILE LOCATION '$INPUT_HDFS/uservisits';
```
```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS uservisits_aggre;
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE uservisits_aggre ( sourceIP STRING, sumAdRevenue DOUBLE) STORED AS  SEQUENCEFILE LOCATION '$OUTPUT_HDFS/uservisits_aggre';

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE uservisits_aggre SELECT sourceIP, SUM(adRevenue) FROM uservisits GROUP BY sourceIP;
```
We thought of installing hibench and playing with it to see if this above workload runs on spark properly - but we got a lot of errors in just the installation process - we just want to inquire if these kinds of queries are optimal for benchmarking spark and hpcc before we spend the time in debugging installation errors of hibench

Spark-Perf
Ref: https://github.com/databricks/spark-perf - suggested by Chin
It doesnt list the sql workloads - says “coming soon”
We found another repo on googling though - https://github.com/databricks/spark-sql-perf
This is alo a framework as per our understanding - to run any benchmarking query
They use the example of TPC-DC benchmark (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raghu_Nambiar/publication/221310091_Why_You_Should_Run_TPC-DS_A_Workload_Analysis/links/56d76c7508aebe4638af1e37.pdf)
This benchmark is vendor neutral - developed with no particular architecture in mind
It is specifically for testing and benchmarking databases and evaluate their performance in case of multi-user concurrent queries
It has 99 query templates - not actual queries

We are planning to use the data generator of vivek nair group written for thor - and run that same data on spark (Ref: https://github.com/hpcc-systems/hpcc-vs-spark/blob/master/benchmarks/Thor/BWR_DataGenerationInteger.ecl) 
Installed dstat on ec2 instance for collecting application stats
HPCC Thor:
  Created a data generator for Thor and ran an ecl count query over it. The datafile contained only integers and its size was 200MB(1.3 sec) and 4.8 GB(30.5 sec).
  I will explore other data types and find which queries make sense for comparison.
Apache Spark:
  Took the data file (csv format) generated for thor by ECL
  Ran sql query on this csv file using interactive shell of spark
  To do: follow the tutorial to submit spark application jobs for scala and run sql queries (https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall15/compsci290.1/TA_Material/jungkang/how_to_run_spark_app.pdf)
